                <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
                <p>I went to a Linux Stammtisch on Thursday 3/8.</p>
                <h4>People I Met</h4>
                <p>Kevin was the organizer and boy was he very enthusiastic about Linux. I also met Chris Fedde who worked for Comcast, Chinni who used to be a structual engineer, and Eric that worked on something called Guard for Lockheed.</p>
                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>First of all, these guys and gals are very serious about Linux. I learned that there is different versions/distributions of Linux, such as Redhat, Ubuntu (what I am currently running), and others. I also learned that AT&T had a big role in the creation of Linux, that was derived from UNIX. Lastly, I learned that Linus Torvalds created Linux in less than two weeks.</p>

                <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
                <p>Last night Wednesday 3/14 I attended the "Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained: How to Get Where You Want to Go" Meetup at GA in the Rino District.</p>
                <h4>People I Met</h4>
                <p>I met Jeri and Joshua, who were a couple that opened Frozen Matter, an ice cream shop in denver. Joshua used came from a background as a software engineer, and Jeri was an attorney.</p>
                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>I learned that all of the presenters were very alike in that they came from a different background relevant to the business that they now own. I also learned that almost all of the entrepreneurs did not have necessary capital to fund their venture, so they had to hussle to find a lender.</p>

                <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
                <p>I attended the Pursuing an IT Career with a Director of IT meetup at the Denver Library on Mon 3/19/18.</p>
                <h4>People I Met</h4>
                <p>WMaryAnne Flynn, which is a Director of IT with Cisco Systems (pretty cool), whom was very nice and willing to sit down and talk sometime after the meetup. I also met Harry Flynn, MaryAnne's husband, whom works for Cisco Systems as well, but in the Finance department.</p>
                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>I learned that there is many different avenues to get into, which is somewhat obvious now that I think about it, being that the IT field is so broad. I also learned that what Galvanize is doing for us is indeed a tried and true method, so much so that she gave the meetup attendees the link to the Platte location and recommended that we go and take a look... lucky us. Lastly, there are multiple certifications that can be obtained in order to help get a job in the IT field.</p>
                <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
                <p>MaryAnne has worked at the Director of IT for Cisco for about twenty years, and she just recently got her certification! I wonder how important are certifications? As long as you can do the thing, right? Are employers wanting to see certifications because it shows that we went through the process?</p>
