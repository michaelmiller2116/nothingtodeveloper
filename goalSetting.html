            <h2>March 13 Goals</h2>
            <h4>Goal 1:</h4>
            <p>Learn how to take screen recordings with Linux and how to upload it to Youtube. DONE</p>
            <h4>Goal 2:</h4>
            <p>Start and finish the reading material for the three steps of the learn to learn process. Including Setting the stage, play, and reflection. DONE</p>
            <h4>Goal 3:</h4>
            <p>Finish 1 Learn to Learn drill before 3pm, then practice lightning talk. DONE</p>
            <h4>Reflection:</h4>
            <p>WWere the goals met? All goals were met today, am I am feeling pretty good about it. What went well? Almost everything. I thought it would be much harder to get a video uploading on youtube, and the reading material was quite short, and easy to follow. Thankfullyl I have taken classes on material like this at my old job. What didn't go well? Linux screen recording! It was a big pain in the you know what for me. Thankfully Jose was able to help with some of the problems that I was having. What will you do differently tomorrow? I dont think my goals were ambitious enough. I would like to give myself one difficuly goal that is acheivable, but would take a mighty effort to complete.</p>

            <h2>March 14 Goals</h2>
            <h4>Goal 1:</h4>
            <p>Submit a meetup drill before noon. Done</p>
            <h4>Goal 2:</h4>
            <p>Complete a Learn to Learn drill in regards to the DOM. Done</p>
            <h4>Goal 3:</h4>
            <p>Answer the following questions for the DOM: Done</p>
            <h4>Question 1:</h4>
            <p>What is the DOM? Document Object Model, an API. It is an object-orientated representation of a web page.</p>        <h4>Question 2:</h4>
            <p>Why use the DOM? It can make the website interactive for the user. So if a user clicks something, the DOM would target a specific element in the html's tree and manipulate it accordingly, instead of the programmer having to go back and write more code.</p>
            <h4>Question 3:</h4>
            <p>How is the DOM used? The DOM is used by targeting specific elements in the html tree with methods such as getElementById/getElementByTagName/querySelector etc, and manipulating them with methods such as innerHTML/addClickListener. etc.</p>
            <h4>Reflection:</h4>
            <p>Were the goals met? Yes. I didn't learn as much as I needed though. Much more to learn.What went well? The Nap! In the middle of reading the documentation on the DOM, I got pretty sleepy, and decided to take a power nap which really helped. What didn't go well? Disctractions. I went to the 4th floor and there were many people sitting around me and I didn't have my music. So I moved on to another spot.What will you do differently tomorrow? Set aside an allotted time to get these goals done, and eliminate any chance for disctractions. </p>

            <h2>March 23 Goals</h2>
            <h4>Goal 1:</h4>
            <p>Turn in the last Learn to Learn and goal setting drills. DONE</p>
            <h4>Goal 2:</h4>
            <p>Submit project 1 by 1:30. FAIL</p>
            <h4>Goal 3:</h4>
            <p>Begin reading for API and answer the following questions. DONE</p>
            <h4>Question 1:</h4>
            <p>What is an API?: An API is like a waiter at a restaurant that takes your order to the kitchen and brings your food (response).</p>
            <h4>Question 2:</h4>
            <p>Who uses APIs and why?: It seems that majority if not almost all major websites use and/or have an API.</p>
            <h4>Question 3:</h4>
            <p>Is there an substitute to using APIs?: Is there an substitute to using APIs? Not that I have found. Google just gives alternates to using REST.</p>
            <h4>Reflection:</h4>
            <p>Were the goals met? No. I was unable to finish my project by 1:30 because I wanted to attend the 1pm API breakout. The Learn to Learn and the goal setting for today will be done in the next ten minutes, which will allow me to turn in my first project! Hell Yeah! What went well? The API reading was not nearly as tough as everyone was making it out to be. I think I have a good grasp on what an API is on a foundational level. Also, I didn't feel lost at all in the API breakout. What didn't go well? Well Linux gave me a hard time when trying to download Postman, but I was able to find some help with good ol' Google. Sitting outside sounded great at first, but wow does your laptop get dusty quick, and I dont have sunglasses with me so I only lasted about five mintues outside. What will you do differently tomorrow? Well looking out on the patio now, the sun isn't beating down on it, so it may be more comfortable to be out there. That still doesn't fix the dust issue though, so I will likely avoid working outside. Other than that, I don't think that I would change anythign. Good Day!</p>
